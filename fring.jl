x,y,z are the 2-dim arrays, which we also use to create the sphere
axis is the axis around which we rotate
w is the angle at which we rotate
by create the circle around whatever axis we want we should be able to rotate it anywhere we want

del is the Î”, thickness of the ring
pos is at which point on the axis it spawns, 0 is for largest radius 
-1 or 1 is for point at the end of the sphere

General idea: create normal rings with ring() as belts at a certain height
Create rotated rings with ring_ex(). A rotation around z and x is sufficient

    #i can make a subroutine in here for additional rotations 
    if axis == "x"
        init = rotated_x
    elseif axis == "y"
        init = rotated_y
    else
        init = rotated_z

                arr[i, j] = 1
